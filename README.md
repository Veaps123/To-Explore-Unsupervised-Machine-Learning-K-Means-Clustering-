# To-Explore-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-K-Means-Clustering-
In this model, we separate the same data in a cluster and different same data in other cluster.  we used unsupervised learning that applies on unlabeled data. 
The right number of clusters was also determined using the "Elbow Method".
First we search apsoulte value of k than we apply the algo for classification.
